**tl;dr**: I've spent the past 10 years at VMware, doing all kinds of techy-producty things. I ran a small data center in Toronto before that. Before _that_ I ran my own small web development shop and worked for a local startup that you've never heard of. I am also a pirate.

Currently, I run product management and marketing for VMware Fusion and Workstation, and have been doing so since 2015.

### Work stuff

My time at VMware started in 2009 in Support, where I launched the team responsible for helping our customers with Fusion and Workstation.

I later moved in to Enterprise Cloud app support, which meant learning how VMware's entire stack worked inside and out in order to help our biggest customers.

From there I made the jump into Product Marketing for Cloud Services, responsible for our first 'Hybrid Cloud' messaging, thanks to some folks who took a chance on an inexperienced but eager Canadian.

I was given the opportunity to write a bit about my career experience at VMware:

From Product Marketing I moved into Technical Marketing for Cloud Services, with responsibilities around supporting 'Dev and Test' workflows, as well as Security and Compliance. I was humbled to have the chance to craft the narrative and demos for the VMworld Keynote stage. https://youtu.be/P5bWlvSr7-A?t=4504

Around here I wrote a little book on how to get the most from VMware Fusion:

In 2015 I took an opportunity within the company to go back to my roots and lead it into the future, so that meant a return to Product Marketing for VMware Fusion and Workstation.

In the years since I've moved into a dual-role and drive Product Management as well as Marketing for VMware Desktop Hypevisors with a responsibility to drive the business group as a whole.

### Outside of work

I enjoy making music, and sometimes post stuff over here:

I mean, you're really hiring the mermaids, but they need help getting around, you see!
