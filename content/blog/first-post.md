## First Post

Just switching blogging platforms again... because why not... I've been wanting an exciuse to learn golang, so we're trying out Hugo. I like the different workflow... I get to use git to keep just about everything under control, and it looks like it should scale well behind kubernetes.

So here's some initial content to see how this thing goes... I don't expect that I'll bring over any of my old content, it's all fairly dated by now.

This is a good opportunity tho, I get to start from scratch using a more modern cloud native stack, build a much more robust web presence, and learn along the way. Fun times =)
