      <description>A wise man once told me that success is part opportunity, part timing, part preparation, and finally, part luck. I add to that list risk and willingness to embrace change.
Coming from a unique and diverse background, I often struggled with a career path that didn’t quite fit who I was. I was very happy as the SysAdmin (Systems Administrator) at a small data center in Toronto, when a unique opportunity came across my lap. That opportunity quickly fell through: the company presented me a false view of their own stability and went belly-up two months after I relocated from Toronto, about 20 days from Christmas. So, I went work for a local Apple support center.
But in 2009, opportunity happened. A teammate of mine got an interview at VMware for a new Fusion support team, and they needed Apple experts. A thorough interview later, they offered me a position, and we moved to create what I consider the best support team with which I’ve had the pleasure of working with.
We not only had a strong technical group (most of whom by now have moved on to more technical roles in and outside of VMware), but we also had a synergy that I’ve not seen outside of VMware Global Support.</description>
